# {{ page.title }}

## Why? Philosophy

Why not use JSON, CSV, XML, YAML, SQL, your <format of choice here>?
Why invent yet another format?

Excercise: Try to add by hand round-by-round the match schedule
for the English Premier League, for example?
Did you enjoy writing the match schedule in JSON? in CSV? in XML? in SQL? in YAML?

Now retry the exercise using the new mini language designed to make hand-crafting
as easy as possible. See the difference?
